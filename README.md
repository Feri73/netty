# Netty-JPMS Project

Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. This fork has migrated Netty to JDK9 and JPMS.

## How to build

You require the following to build Netty-JPMS:

* Latest stable Oracle JDK 9+
* Latest stable [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)
* If you are on Linux, you need [additional development packages](http://netty.io/wiki/native-transports.html) installed on your system, because you'll build the native transport.
